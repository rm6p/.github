Hello!

Welcome to the Realme 6 Pro Organisation.

This organisation was created for maintaining all the trees for realme 6 pro (RMX2061/3) and to have all the repos updated with changes made by all the devs that have worked on this device. I no longer maintain these and in the current state they are sufficient for building Android 14 ROMs. You can use the trees as you wish for futher development.


Vendor trees are available in Gitlab for DMCA reasons. For vendor trees visit:
> https://gitlab.com/debdeep199x/vendor_realme_rmx2061

> https://gitlab.com/debdeep199x/vendor_realme_sm7125-common

- Please push changes if any, in proper branches.
- Do not delete repos/branches
- If you prefer, you can maintain your own orgs, but keep the trees public for community.
